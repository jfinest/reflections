When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  First if other people are helping or are making additions to the projects. 
Secondly if its something minor and quick might be something that can be done from the github website. 
Lastly, if you dont current have access to your files locally.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  One, beacuse you might not know when the automatic pulls might happen. Also, because if you are not ready to commit those chnages or want to make edits before commiting automatic pulls might make that happen before you want them to. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is like clone but is doing the cloning in your github account only. Clone allows you to make a copy into your local machine. And branches can be used to have different stages of your project at once but can only be add/deleted from local machine. Forks can be used when it has to do with collaborations or simply want to do things from github directly. Cloning is when you want to work locally but also when doing things with codes as caroline stated t would be easier to work from local machine. And branches is good when you want to experiment with different aspects of the project.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  This might help in case something ever happen the to server holding the remote's copy. That way you the local version is your backup.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  Oher then obvious option to emailing between collaborators would be maybe find a way to share project remotely. 
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  Like previously mentioned, master branch is basically the final version of hte project. So when there is a time you want to experiment or modify certain aspect of the project then branch off the master to make those changes.

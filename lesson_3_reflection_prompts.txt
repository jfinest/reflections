When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  First if other people are helping or are making additions to the projects. 
Secondly if its something minor and quick might be something that can be done from the github website. 
Lastly, if you dont current have access to your files locally.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  One, beacuse you might not know when the automatic pulls might happen. Also, because if you are not ready to commit those chnages or want to make edits before commiting automatic pulls might make that happen before you want them to.
